After years in cyber security, I've made the leap to indie hacking. This post is about why I'm choosing to build in public and what you can expect from this journey.

## The Corporate Exit

Working in cyber security gave me incredible technical skills and insights into how systems work at scale. But it also showed me the limitations of working within large organizations:

- Slow decision making
- Limited creative freedom
- Building someone else's vision
- Bureaucratic overhead

I realized I wanted to build something of my own, something that could make a real impact while giving me the freedom to innovate.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public isn't just about transparency – it's about:

### Accountability
When you share your progress publicly, you create natural accountability. It's harder to give up when people are following your journey.

### Learning Opportunities
Sharing your work opens you up to feedback, suggestions, and connections you wouldn't otherwise have.

### Building an Audience
By documenting the process, you build an audience alongside your product. This becomes invaluable for future launches.

### Helping Others
Your struggles and successes can help other indie hackers avoid pitfalls and find inspiration.

## What I'm Building

I'm focused on building tools that solve real problems I've encountered in my career:

- Security automation tools for small businesses
- Developer productivity applications
- Educational content around cybersecurity

Each project will be documented here, from initial idea to launch and beyond.

## The Road Ahead

This journey won't be easy. There will be failed launches, technical challenges, and moments of doubt. But that's exactly why building in public is so powerful – it turns the journey into a shared experience.

If you're considering your own indie hacking journey, I hope my experiences can provide some value. Feel free to reach out with questions or just to connect.

Let's build something amazing together.
